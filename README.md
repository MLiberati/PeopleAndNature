# PeopleAndNature
Spreadsheets and R scripts to reproduce the figures from Liberati et al., "Planning for people and nature"

This project had three conservation programs involved in the indicator selectino process. Please refer to the article's methods section for information about the programs and who was involved in the process. For file naming conventions, we refered to the groups as:
A. Agriculture
B. Coastal Wetlands
C. Urban

Step 1. Identify Objectives

See Table 3 and Appendix B in the article for information on Objectives.

Step 2. Develop Alternatives

See "GLOBAL LIST - METRIC LIST.xlsx" for a full list of indicators that were identified by our teams. 
For a list of indicators that were scored during Step 3, see "SCORING LIST - METRIC LIST - with Shorthand.xlsx" 

Step 3. Estimate Consequences

Consequences scores broken out for each participatns can be found in files titled - "[Team Name] - Individual Scores - Revised - 2019.11.05.xlsx"
Consequences scores that are summarized for each team can be found in files titles - "IndividualScores_[Team Name}_2019.11.05.xlsx"
Consequence scores for data-richness and realism are in this file - "Inidicator Scoring - Data-richness & Realism - 2020.04.16.xlsx"

Step 4. Making Tradeoffs

Each teams had an Excel workbook where they explored the influence of different weighting scenarios of indicator selection. These files are titled:
"Winnowing_Workbook_[Team Name].xlsx". 
These workbooks were created with an R scripted titled - "Tradeoff_Workbooks_2021.02.23.R"

Additional files: R scripts were used to create article figures and those scripts received eponymous file names (e.g., "Fig3_Alternatives_2021.02.22.R")
